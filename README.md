# django-and-web
This is a django and Web front - and back -end separation project.
# Topic

The topic of this project  is  professional analysis,which  can  help  them get employed.
However,this project is not perfect yet,and I  will continue to  improve  it.

by the way,The repository is full of front-end code,and The Django deployment side is still being optimized,
if you need project and run,you need to have Django and the front-end on the same LAN

There are some bugs in this project,please bear with me
