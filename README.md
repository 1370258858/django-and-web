# django-and-web
This is a django and Web front - and back -end separation project.

# Introduce
The topic of this project  is  professional analysis,which  can  help  them get employed.
However,this project is not perfect yet,and I  will continue to  improve  it.

by the way,The repository is full of front-end code,and The Django deployment side is still being optimized,
if you need project and run,you need to have Django and the front-end on the same LAN

There are some bugs in this project,please bear with me

# file path
third director is django file
first/first/web director is web file

# run
The web file need environment in the vscode,you can use Extensions "Live Server" to start web project.by the way,you should change .html run path.

The django you only use command "python manage.py runserver",but you should install django package and stay same path with manage.py.
